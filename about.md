I am a software engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) and a graduate student at the [Open University of Israel](http://www.openu.ac.il). I am interested in different aspects of programming and particularly in large and distributed software development and modularization techniques.

I live in Tel-Aviv, Israel.

# Projects
Following are the projects I work on nowadays or worked on in the past.  
More information about my open source contributions is available on [Open HUB](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/Arik_Hadas/).

## oVirt {#ovirt}
[oVirt](http://www.ovirt.org) is a virtualization management platform optimized to the KVM hypervisor. It was founded by Red Hat as a community project on which Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization is based. It allows centralized management of virtual machines, compute, storage and networking resources, from an easy to use web-based front-end with platform independent access.

I have been contributing to oVirt since 2012, mainly to VM-lifecycle related flows in ovirt-engine. Since 2014 I am a co-maintainer of ovirt-engine.  

The code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/ovirt).

## muCommander
[muCommander](http://www.mucommander.com) is a lightweight, cross-platform file manager with a dual-pane interface. It runs on any operating system with Java support (Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, BSD, Solaris...).

Since 2007 I have been contributing to muCommander. These days I maintain the project.

The code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/mucommander).

## AOP-Awesome
A multi-DSAL development is a mode of application developemnt where in addition to one or more general purpose languages (e.g., Java, AspectJ), multiple domain-specific aspect languages (DSALs) are used. For example, one DSAL (e.g., COOL) may be used for implementing the thread synchronization concern, other for the security concern, etc. [Awesome](http://aop.cslab.openu.ac.il/research/awesome) is an aspect composition framework. Awesome makes multi-DSAL development feasible by allowing to compose a variety of aspect mechanisms, each corresponding to a specific DSAL, into a single multi-mechanism weaver.

I upgraded Awesome to latest versions of AspectJ and extended it to support [explicit join points](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1294335&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=596909188&CFTOKEN=29117700) and [closure joinpoints](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1960291&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=596909188&CFTOKEN=29117700).

The code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenUniversity).

# Research
Surprisingly, although aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is known as a programming paradigm that promotes better modularization of crosscutting-concerns, it is underutilized in real-world projects that suffer from crosscutting-concerns. As part of my MSc thesis I have been researching new approaches and tools to improve the practicality side of AOP.

My advisor is [Prof. David H. Lorenz](https://www.google.co.il/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj99_6MtPDLAhXCtBoKHYMZAq4QFggbMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.openu.ac.il%2Fhome%2Florenz%2F&usg=AFQjCNGqw4RqD7ImwOsYSo0A5HQ8S9t6kQ&sig2=c2oRZVQhU4g4CqAoujmVgA).

My research interests:  
Aspect oriented programming (AOP)  
Domain specific languages (DSL)  
Software development methodologies and tools.
